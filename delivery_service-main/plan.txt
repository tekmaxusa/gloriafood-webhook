- No delivery service currently available
- Need to integrate with DoorDash API for driver assignment
- Store owners need real-time delivery updates

TARGET STATE
===========
- Automated delivery order processing
- Real-time driver assignment via DoorDash
- Email notifications to store owners
- Seamless integration with existing GloriaFood system
- Handle 50,000+ monthly orders efficiently

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
======================
AWS Services:
- AWS Lambda (Serverless compute)
- API Gateway (API management)
- DynamoDB (Order tracking)
- SNS (Email notifications)
- CloudWatch (Monitoring & logging)
- IAM (Security & permissions)
- SQS (Message queuing for high volume)

Integration Points:
- GloriaFood API (Source of delivery orders)
- DoorDash API (Driver assignment & tracking)
- Email service (Store owner notifications)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
======================
Lambda Functions:
- Order Processing Function (High-volume optimized)
- Driver Assignment Function
- Status Update Function
- Email Notification Function
- Queue Processing Function

Database Tables:
- Orders (order_id, store_id, customer_info, delivery_address, status, created_at)
- Deliveries (delivery_id, order_id, driver_info, status, estimated_arrival)
- Store_Notifications (store_id, email, notification_preferences)
- Order_Queue (queue_id, order_id, priority, retry_count)

API Endpoints:
- POST /orders (Receive delivery orders from GloriaFood)
- GET /orders/{order_id}/status (Check order status)
- POST /deliveries/{delivery_id}/update (Update delivery status)
- GET /orders/bulk-status (Batch status updates)

Performance Requirements:
- Process 50,000 orders per month
- Handle peak loads (e.g., 100+ orders per hour during busy times)
- Order processing latency: <30 seconds
- Email notification delivery: <2 minutes

AWS COST ESTIMATION (50,000 orders/month)
==========================================

Monthly Costs:
- Lambda: $1-3 (50K+ invocations, optimized execution)
- API Gateway: $0.35 (255K+ API calls, HTTP API)
- RDS PostgreSQL: $15-30 (t3.micro instance, 10GB+ storage)
- SNS: $5-15 (50K+ email notifications)
- SQS: $5-15 (Message queuing)
- CloudWatch: $0-5 (Standard monitoring, likely free tier)
- Total Estimated Monthly: $26-68

Annual Costs:
- Estimated Annual Total: $312 - $816

One-Time Setup Costs:
- Development & Testing: $500-1,000
- Initial Configuration: $200-400
- Load Testing: $300-500

LABOR COSTS
===========
Development Team:
- Paul (Project Manager): Free
- Jeremiah (Developer): $3/hour
- Qodo AI: $360/year

Estimated Development Hours:
- Phase 1 (Planning): 40 hours × $3 = $120
- Phase 2 (API Integration): 120 hours × $3 = $360
- Phase 3 (Core Development): 160 hours × $3 = $480
- Phase 4 (Testing): 80 hours × $3 = $240
- Phase 5 (Go-Live): 40 hours × $3 = $120
- Total Development Hours: 440 hours
- Total Labor Cost: $1,320

Total Project Cost (AWS + Labor):
- AWS Annual: $312-816
- Labor: $1,320
- Qodo AI Annual: $360
- Total: $1,992-2,496

COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
============================
- Lambda function optimization for faster execution (target: <$3/month)
- API Gateway HTTP API usage (vs REST API for cost savings)
- DynamoDB auto-scaling and on-demand pricing
- SQS for batching and reducing API calls
- ElastiCache to reduce database calls
- CloudWatch insights for cost monitoring

RISKS & MITIGATION
==================
High Risk:
- API rate limits from DoorDash (50K orders = high API usage)
- Integration complexity with existing GloriaFood system
- High-volume processing performance
- Delivery timing accuracy under load

Mitigation:
- Implement sophisticated rate limiting and queuing
- Thorough API testing and documentation review
- Load testing and performance optimization
- Real-time status updates and notifications
- Auto-scaling and failover mechanisms

Medium Risk:
- Email delivery reliability at high volume
- Lambda function performance under load
- Data consistency with high transaction volume
- Cost overruns with unexpected volume spikes

Mitigation:
- Multiple notification channels and retry logic
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Transaction management and rollback
- Cost alerts and budget monitoring

SUCCESS METRICS
===============
- Successful delivery order processing: >98%
- Average order-to-driver assignment time: <2 minutes
- Email notification delivery rate: >99%
- System uptime: >99.5%
- Order processing latency: <30 seconds
- Cost per order: <$0.015

DELIVERABLES
